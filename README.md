### Installation
1. upload the files
2. go to index.php (it should create bingo_words.txt, game_title.txt and bingo_players.json)
3. click the admin link in the lower right
4. create your admin username and password
5. name the game
6. add all the bingo words/phrases, one line at a time.
7. hit update.
8. tell all your buddies.

After the game finishes you can delete the players to start again from the admin panel.

Note: this is meant to be a friendly game between friends, so there are no passwords for players, just usernames...this could easily be added, if you care.

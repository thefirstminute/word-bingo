# word-bingo
word bingo game. these are words you can add...find cash on ground, or stub your pinky toe - you dicide how you "win"

Should be as simple as uploading to a server and going to the url; The index file should create the required bingo_words.txt and bingo_players.json files automatically.

(You may have to chmod 666 the bingo_players.json file)

Note: this is meant to be a friendly game between friends, so there are no passwords, just usernames...this could easily be added, if you care.

adding admin soon...right now just change the bingo_words.txt file so you have one word/phrase per line
